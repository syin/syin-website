I've been trying to [blog](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) for the past few years, but haven't gotten to the point where I was happy enough with anything I had written to post it online. Obviously, I need to write more in order to improve my writing, so I'm starting a blog where I focus on [quantity over quality](https://excellentjourney.net/2015/03/04/art-fear-the-ceramics-class-and-quantity-before-quality/) and intentionally publishing poor writing.

I want to avoid the cliche of blogging about blogging, so I'll conclude this short introduction with topics I hope to cover in later posts:
- a learning log (not necessarily programming-related)
- discussions of books I've read
- various technology or computer science thoughts. I've been having IM conversations with friends recently that helped me articulate and clarify ideas, and I should distill those thoughts in longform writing as well.
